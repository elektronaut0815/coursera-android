coursera-android
================

Source Code for Android Course Example Applications    

* forked from https://github.com/aporter/coursera-android  
* enhanced with Gradle build files based on the work in https://github.com/bond-/coursera-android

In contrast to the original repo which represents ADT projects,  
here you find the Gradle files needed in order to use the code inside IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio
